# generator_concepts

TODO: Local Cookbook development concepts.

These cookbooks are generated by our generator lcd_origin

Which we created using "chef generate generator "generator/<name>"

---------------------------------------------------------------
Here we are going through some of the chef-Spec(unit in memory) testing concepts.

![spec](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17291791/28255679-9940b0f0-6aa9-11e7-8501-642bc0a6f961.jpg)

and integration testing via chef kitchen.

![kitchen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17291791/28255678-992ad51e-6aa9-11e7-8de5-5afe1df0551a.png)

includes and excludes present in the .kitchen.yml file will exclude one platform or list of them and include will include one or more of them.

chef generate cookbook will generate .kitchen.yml file in which it refrences explicitly to the test/default/smoke dir.

but we dnt need to do that if we put our test in test/integration/<suit-name>/test.rb

*kitchen* init can create the .kitchen.yml file for us 

kitchen init
create  .kitchen.yml
      create  chefignore
      create  test/integration/default

and this makes the dir structure it refrences automatically to look for the tests. we dnt need to explicitly refrence it by 

 verifier:
      inspec_tests:
        - test/integration/<suit-name>

we can specify driver while generating .kitchen.yml file.

kitchen init --driver=drivername

find driver name we want by *kitchen driver discover*
