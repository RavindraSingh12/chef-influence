# generator_concepts

TODO: Local Cookbook development concepts.

These cookbooks are generated by our generator lcd_origin

Which we created using "chef generate generator "generator/<name>"

---------------------------------------------------------------
Here we are going through some of the chef-Spec(unit in memory) testing concepts.

and integration testing via chef kitchen.

includes and excludes present in the .kitchen.yml file will exclude one platform or list of them and include will include one or more of them.
